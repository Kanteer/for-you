EDIT 4/26/20 - I wrote this before Based decided to quit. This isn't influenced by him in any way. No, I'm not quitting. I'll still be active in the server and game, just not mapping.

I decided to take some time and write this out, to express myself in a way that I can't say on the server. I'm gonna take a break from mapping for a bit. I don't know when I'll continue, but I hope it's going to be soon. This wont be a very long break, probably only a few days or a week. I just need time to cool down due to the stress Trial Mapper is putting me on.

I admit, I can't take critisism. But, sometimes I really do have to stand up and take a step towards the right direction by asking for it. It's not easy for me to accept that something I did was wrong or bad. I just can't bring myself to the conclusion that they are correct, and I often will feel bad about myself for accepting it. I'll tell myself that everything that I did was wrong, and I should quit. But I'm not going to listen to those thoughts. I'm going to keep striving for mapper as best as I can. And I'm only doing this because I love Sound Space and want to be part of the game, and on the team. It's been a dream of mine ever since I started mapping.

Anyways, I'm gonna take a break for mapping for a while, to recollect my thoughts. I can assure you that I will come back stronger and better.

Love you, tripple
